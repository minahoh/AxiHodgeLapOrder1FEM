# AxiHodgeLapOrder1FEM

The goal of this project is to use higher order finite element methods to construct a family of Fourier finite element spaces that can be applied to axisymmetric problems and then to apply them to discretize the Hodge Laplacian problem on axisymmetric domains. This work will extend the results of the papers by Minah Oh, de Rham complexes arising from Fourier finite element methods in axisymmetric domains, Computers & Mathematics with Applications, Volume 70, Issue 8, 2015 and The Hodge Laplacian on axisymmetric domains and its discretization, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, 2020, where the author uses the lowest order finite element spaces

This is joint work between Minah Oh (Associate Professor of Mathematics at James Madison University) and Nicole Stock (Senior at James Madison Universty). It is also a part of Nicole Stock's Honor's project.
